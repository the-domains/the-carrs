2016 is here, and so is a new site for the family. Today I got access to "[The Grid][0]", a service that claims to take away all the complexity of web site layout, and everything that goes with it.

So this site will be both a place to showcase what we are currently up to as a family, and also to test out this new service. So stick with us, while we embark on this bold journey.
